        		What makes inspiration? Inspiration is something, or someone, that we look up to. Inspiration embodies what we truly value most; Therefore who we select as a role model(s) says a lot about who we are as people.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        	  Inspiration to me has the following characteristics:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Creative Vision - Someone who has a unique eye for the unconventional.</li>
        		<li>Imagination - Someone who can think outside the box - in terms of an image and in life.</li>
        		<li>Impact on an Industry - Someone who can single handedly transform how things are done.</li>
        		<li>Growth - They strive for growth, never being satisfied with their current position.</li>
        		<li>Enjoyment - they live true to their calling, and you can see it in their work.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Larry Chen has been a world renowned automotive photographer for over 15 years. Starting as a low level photographer who sought after every opportunity he could find, Larry Chen got his big break in 2012 for the Formula Drift photography team, never looking back. Since then, Chen has set the standard for what automotive photographers can do. Currently, Chen shoots for magazines like HotRod, SuperStreet, as well as Hoonigan.
