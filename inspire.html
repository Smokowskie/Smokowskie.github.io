        		What makes inspiration? Inspiration is something that we look up to. Inspiration embodies what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        	  Inspiration to me has the following characteristics.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Creative Vision - Someone who has a unique eye for the unconventional.</li>
        		<li>Imagination - Someone who can think outside the box in terms of an image.</li>
        		<li>Impact on Industry - Someone who can single handedly transform how things are done.</li>
        		<li>Growth - They strive for growth, never satisfied with current position.</li>
        		<li>Enjoyment - they live true to their calling, and you can see it in their work.</li>
    		</ul>
