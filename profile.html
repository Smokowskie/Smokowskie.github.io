              <p>I am currently a Finance student at the University of Northern Colorado. I am looking to graduate in May of 2023.</p>
              <p>Recently, I have found a passion in photography. Through my interests in cars, I began experimenting with a hand-me-down camera, and havent looked back since!</p>
              <p>With this new found passion, I hope to keep advancing my skills and techniques into something more than a hobby and side hustle.</p>
